CIIDefence: Defeating Adversarial Attacks by Fusing Class-specific Image Inpainting and Image Denoising
ICCV2019![image](https://github.com/mmmency/CIIDefence/assets/104192439/d9dfd546-c9cc-49fd-9932-e2bbe614a60b)presents a novel approach for protecting deep neural networks from adversarial attacks, i.e., methods that add well-crafted imperceptible modifications to the original inputs such that they are incorrectly classified with high confidence.
